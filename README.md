Bank robbery game
As part of my game development course grade, I developed a game that simulates a bank robbery using Unity. The game includes many heavy files.
While making this project, I implemented C# scripts such as: character's motion, weapon loading, bank queues, bullet-shots and more. Game-mode videos attached below:
